        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <img src="assets/images/about_img_150.jpg" class="auth-image"" alt="Albino squirrel on UT campus"><p>I have had the pleasure of living in Austin almost twenty-five years. I got my BFA from U. of North Carolina School of the Arts with a focus in Theatrical Stage Management. I worked one year in Cleveland, Ohio at The Cleveland Playhouse as a Stage Manager, but one winter in Cleveland was enough for me.</p>
        
        <p>On the recommendation of a friend and being that it was close to my home town--Houston--I moved to Austin in the mid-90s. I took some web design classes back when it was just basic HTML. Wow! That was a long time ago , especially in technology years.</p>
            
        <p>My little bit of understanding of HTML helped me get my first "real" job as a project manager in the Digital Media department at Holt, Rinehart and Winston, an educational publisher. Since then, I've been project managing various kinds of digital projects at a few different companies around Austin, mostly in learning and educational areas.</p>
        
        <p>Obviously, things have changed a lot since then, in Austin and the world in general. I'm eager to learn the latest tools and technologies for full stack web development. I've got a lot of catching up to do! But once I am caught up I looking forward to being a highly skilled full stack web developer and project manager and taking on more interesting and productive opportunities.</p>
